                    Hi, my name is Zaheer! I'm a recent graduate of uOttawa, where I studied Computer Science and Statistics. Moving forward,
                    I'm interested in leveraging this background, along with my interests in psychology, politics, and economics, to explore topics
                    in usability as applied to systems which promote safety and demand security, such as in healthcare settings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm currently taking a gap year to work on projects, engage in community work, and study some subjects which I didn't
                    have time for in undergrad. In the past, I have worked as an intern in software development, 
                    and as a summer research assistant in quantum computing at uOttawa.

                        Under Professor Arthur Mehta in the Department of Mathematics, I spent the summer studying and experimenting with non-local games.
                        In particular, working alongside a graduate student and fellow undergraduate, we explored variants of the CHSH game.
                        Some of that work looked like:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reading notes on the mathematical foundations of quantum computing and papers
                                pertaining to variants of the CHSH game. This involved learning about tensors, higher order functions, quantum channels,
                                and lots more — particularly in the context of quantum computing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Running 1000's of simulations of the multiplicative variants of the standard, mod-2 CHSH game as generated
                                from roots of unity. Done in Python, this required
                                the use of IBM's Qiskit library as well as numpy, sympy, and others to encode the components of the quantum circuits and run the simulations.
                            </li>
                            <li>Preparing slides to for a presentation about quantum computing for undergraduate science students. The presentation centred around the notion
                                of quantum advantage, and how the CHSH game proves this by way of the improvement of a quantum strategy over the optimal classical strategy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        It was a fantastic experience, and I'm thankful to have been exposed to higher-level mathematics and explore its applications in
                        quantum computing.

                        While an intern, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of interesting and high-impact projects.
                        Working in the manufacturing division, I was generally responsible for producing analytics and software solutions
                        to improve quality and efficiency of operations across manufacturing at CBNC.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of my projects were:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating a program for production processing and product verification, used to help workers on the factory floor
                                operate more safely and effectively. This involved conducting user interviews with 5-10 users, designing the user interface
                                in accordance with their needs, and then writing the backend. The backend was built in Python, 
                                and involved multithreading, networking, and computer vision — exciting stuff!
                            </li>
                            <li> Developing a machine learning model using density-based clustering to better predict machine failure. 
                                I leveraged my knowledge of metric spaces to define a custom metric specific to the dataset, and used that
                                to determine a threshold across certain parameters after which machine failure was likely.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Creating a real-time analytics dashboard with Power BI, Python, and Azure to track and visualise sensor data. This was done
                                in order to understand which machines were going down and when, as well as how productive each station was as part of the production line. This involved
                                taking in data hourly from 100's of sensor inputs across 10's of machines.
                            </li>

                        As part of a final project for my Great Algorithms class, myself and two group members explored the Minimax algorithm, its
                        applications in common games and beyond, and how it compares to other algorithmic strategies such as the greedy strategy.
                        Following the project, I developed an implementation of the Minimax algorithm in the context of tic-tac-toe, where a player
                        tries his hand at an agent using the Minimax strategy. The game can be played <a href="./Minitac/index.html">here</a>, while the paper our team

                        In this project, I took the well-known Collatz conjecture from mathematics
                        and used recursion to model it. I then played around with the behaviour some more,
                        and upon visualising the behaviour of Collatz Numbers (a term I came up with 
                        to describe the number of iterations it takes for the algorithm to reach 1), I discovered the existence of "Collatz Clusters" 
                        — consecutive numbers which share the same Collatz Number. A deeper dive into the project can be

                        As part of SEG 2105, a class on Software Engineering that I took at uOttawa, 
                        I collaborated with a group member to create Mealer — a Skip the Dishes clone.
                        As part of this project, we developed the mobile app using Java and XML, creating an app that allowed
                        customers to place orders for food items at various restaurants, and restaurants to list items available
                        for purchase to customers. 
                        To support user accounts and dynamic restaurant info, we used Firebase in conjunction
                        with OAuth on the backend. Design was done in Figma. The repository can be found
